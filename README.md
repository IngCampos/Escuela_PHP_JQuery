# PHP School Roll Call

_Website for attendance optimization (call the roll) in a school._

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Project developed in a subject when I was student.
As better developer **I rebuilt all the project** whit my better skills.
Note: The project does the same (modules, views, database).

### Achievements :star2:

As IT student, I knew already about databases and PHP vanilla.
Now I know **composer** and I have worked whit Laravel and Symfony I improved the project whit:

- Configure **composer** to respect [PSR4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standard.
- Install and configure third party packages and respect [PSR7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) standard.
- Implement **Model-View-Controller pattern** and **Front Controller**.
- **Create a basic ORM(instead of use Eloquent and use the initial way to access to the database), using OOP and SQL queries**.
- Implement Twig in order to have **better views**.
- Improve the URL as /rolecall/{class_id} instead of /rolecall?class_id=*.
- Clean and optimize the code.
