# PHP School Rollcall 

_Website for attendance optimization in a generic school._

---------------------

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Project developed in a subject when I was student.
As better developer **I remade all the project** with my better skills.

### Achievements :star2:

As IT student, I knew already about databases and PHP vanilla.
Now I know **composer** and I have worked with Laravel and Symfony I improved the project with:

- Configure **composer** to respect [PSR4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standard.
- Install and configure third party packages and respect [PSR7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) standard.
- Implement **Model-View-Controller pattern** and **Front Controller**.
- **Create a basic ORM(instead of use Eloquent and use the initial way to access to the database), using OOP and SQL queries**.
- Implement Twig in order to have **better views**.
- Improve the URL as /rolecall/{class_room_id} instead of /rolecall?class_room_id=*.
- Implement **library for database management** instead of load a SQL script.
- Improve the design, color palette and HTML semantic.
- Implement docker and docker compose for a better environment.

## Getting Started :rocket:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

The programs you need are:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
-   [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing üîß

First duplicate the file .env.example as .env.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: You could change some values, anyway docker-compose create the database according to the defined values.

Create the image (php:7.4-composer-npm) and run the services (php, nginx and mysql):

```
docker-compose up
```

Note: The next steps can be automated by running

```
sh ./install.sh
```

Then install the PHP packages.

```
docker-compose exec app composer install
```

Finally generate the database and fill it with testing data:

```
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phinx migrate
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phinx seed:run
```

And now you have all the environment, the nginx server is in the port 8000 (e.g http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
