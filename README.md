_Website for attendance optimization in a generic school._

### Project goal by mascam97

This was a [project developed](https://github.com/mascam97/php-school-rollcall/tree/3c5f1bb4af2f09d55142fba9c01f919fd1b72030) with vanilla PHP in a subject when I was student.
Now **I refactored all the project** with better practices (MVC, Composer, etc), similar to professional framework.

Due to this project does not have testing, is not deployed anymore and does not have more purposes, is no longer maintained.

### Achievements :star2:

- Configured **composer** to respect [PSR4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standard.
- Installed third party packages and respect [PSR7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) standard.
- Implemented **Model-View-Controller pattern** and **Front Controller**.
- Implemented a basic ORM using OOP and SQL queries.
- Implemented Twig in order to have better views.
- Improved the URLs (/rolecall/{class_room_id} instead of /rolecall?class_room_id=*).
- Implemented libraries for database management (migrations and seeders).
- Improved the design, palette colors and HTML semantic.
- Implemented docker compose for a better environment.

## Getting Started :rocket:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

The programs you need are:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
-   [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing üîß

First duplicate the file .env.example as .env.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: You could change some values, anyway docker-compose create the database according to the defined values.

Create the image (php:7.4-composer-npm) and run the services (php, nginx and mysql):

```
docker-compose up
```

Note: You can run the last command in the background with `docker-compose up -d`.

Now you have all the environment ready, for the next commands you need to be inside of the app container with:

```
docker-compose exec app /bin/bash
```

Then install the PHP packages.

```
composer install
```

Finally generate the database and fill it with testing data:

```
vendor/bin/phinx migrate
vendor/bin/phinx seed:run
```

And now you have all the environment in the port 8000.

Note: Use `exit` command to exit from the container, `docker-compose down` to delete the containers and `docker volume rm php-school-rollcall_mysql` to delete the database volume.
