# PHP School Rollcall 

_Website for attendance optimization in a generic school._

---------------------

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Project developed in a subject when I was student.
As better developer **I remade all the project** with my better skills.

### Achievements :star2:

As IT student, I knew already about databases and PHP vanilla.
Now I know **composer** and I have worked with Laravel and Symfony I improved the project with:

- Configure **composer** to respect [PSR4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standard.
- Install and configure third party packages and respect [PSR7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) standard.
- Implement **Model-View-Controller pattern** and **Front Controller**.
- **Create a basic ORM(instead of use Eloquent and use the initial way to access to the database), using OOP and SQL queries**.
- Implement Twig in order to have **better views**.
- Improve the URL as /rolecall/{class_room_id} instead of /rolecall?class_room_id=*.
- Implement **library for database management** instead of load a SQL script.
- Improve the design, color palette and HTML semantic.

## Getting Started :rocket:

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

The programs you need are:

-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
